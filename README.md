## Attention Schemas in Artificial Neural Networks

Code accompanying the paper "Improving How Agents Cooperate: Attention Schemas in Artificial Neural Networks." 

Experiments 1, 2, and 3 can be run with the following notebooks:
* `attentiontask.ipynb`: the attention tensor discrimination task in Experiment 1
* `imageclassification.ipynb`: the general image classification tasks (A, B, and C) in Experiment 1, and the transfer learning task in Experiment 2
* `jointcoloring.ipynb`: the cooperative MARL task ("coloring") in Experiment 3

The full dataset **(5.26 GB)** containing all training and validation images and attention tensors is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wczGhJcCfDbC3Nf6vlzCpdiZMA22LR9Q/view?usp=sharing). 

CSV files containing experimental results, as well as the code used to generate figures and statistics, can be found in the `figures` directory.
